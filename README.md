##  Project Summary
This repository contains detailed manual and automated test scenarios for the OLX.ba platform. Testing was conducted using both the JUnit testing framework and Selenium WebDriver.

OLX.ba is one of the most popular platforms in the region, both culturally and in user traffic. Its success hinges on its reputation as a secure and reliable marketplace for listing and purchasing goods.

This project was both rewarding and educational. We are proud of the outcome and the lessons learned. It gave us hands-on exposure to quality assurance, and both of us are now actively considering testing roles during our internship search.

Some of our key takeaways include:
- The importance of time management
- The reality of debugging taking more time than development
- Understanding workload complexity

  - JUnit testing framework  
  - Selenium WebDriver  

- **Total Tests Executed**: 67  
- **Tests Passed**: 64  
- **Success Rate**: 95.52%
